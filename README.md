# oasys
A web application to connect university students

## Running 
Install [maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). Then run `mvn spring-boot:run`

Note that there is an application secrets file that is required to run the backend server. The file contains credentials for connecting to the database. You can configure spring to use an in-memory database instead if you are interested in running this.
